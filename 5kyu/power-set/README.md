# [By the Power Set of Castle Grayskull](https://www.codewars.com/kata/53d3173cf4eb7605c10001a8)

## Description:

Write a function that returns all of the sublists of a list or Array.

Your function should be pure; it cannot modify its input.

Example:

```javascript
power([1,2,3]);
// => [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
```
